# Coordinate Geometry using OOP in Python

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of coordinate geometry concepts using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It includes classes and methods to calculate various geometric properties such as distance, midpoint, and slope.

## ðŸ›  Features
- **Point Class**: Represents a point in a 2D coordinate system.
- **Distance Calculation between 2 points**: Computes the distance between two points using Eucledian distance.
- **Distance of Cordinate from origin**: Finds the distance of the cordinates from the origin.
- **Line Class**: Represents a line equation using two points.
- **Check whether the point lies on a given line**: Determines whether the given cordinates falls on the line.
- **Disance betweeen a given 2D Point and given Line**: Calculates shortest distance between the point and line.
- **Intersection of Two Lines**: Checks whether 2 lines intersect each other or not.

  ## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
